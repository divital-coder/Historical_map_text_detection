# Historical_map_text_detection
Detecting warped text from historical maps and images with the help of azure AI Vision and Image Analysis services.

## Warped Text Detection from historical maps 
Detecting warped text from historical maps is a complex yet fascinating challenge that holds significant importance for historical research and preservation. These maps often contain crucial geographical, cultural, and socio-political information that has been distorted over time due to aging, environmental factors, and the methods used in their creation.

## Potential Solution
To address this, we are leveraging Azure AI Cognitive Services and Azure AI Image Analysis to create a robust solution for identifying and interpreting warped text from these historical documents. The project aims to utilize advanced image processing capabilities, including optical character recognition (OCR) and visual feature extraction, to accurately detect and read distorted text.

## Miscellaneous 
--  By analyzing local images with the Image Analysis Client, we can extract valuable information from historical maps, thus preserving historical knowledge and making it accessible for academic research, digital archiving, and educational purposes.
-- This project not only contributes to the preservation of our cultural heritage but also showcases the powerful applications of modern AI technologies in solving historical and document analysis problems.
